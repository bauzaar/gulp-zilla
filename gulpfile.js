/*  gulpfile.js  ===========  Rather than manage one giant configuration file responsible  for creating multiple tasks, each task has been broken out into  its own file in gulp/tasks. Any files in that directory get  automatically required below.  To add a new task, simply add a new task file that directory.  gulp/tasks/default.js specifies the default set of tasks to run  when you run `gulp`.*/var require_dir = require('require-dir');process.GULP_FISHBONE_PARAMS = {  base: './baufrontend',  src: '/static_src/',  templates: '/templates/'};// Require all tasks in gulp/tasks, including subfoldersrequire_dir('./gulp_tasks', { recurse: true });
